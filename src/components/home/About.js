              <p>
                Howdy! My name is Brandon and I love developing projects that make life simpler for
                their users. My passion for software engineering started back in 2014 when I created
                a simple chess application in Java that included a simple computer AI to challenge. 
                Creating this program with my friend taught me several skills I apply to this day: 
                object-oriented programming, basics of machine-learning, and the value of teamwork 
                while coding.
